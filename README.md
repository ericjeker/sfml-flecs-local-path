# SFML Flecs Local Pathfinding

> "How do agents find optimal paths in dynamic environments using only local information?"

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement pathfinding algorithms in a game engine using SFML and Flecs, focusing on 
local pathfinding strategies. The goal is to enable agents to navigate efficiently in dynamic environments without 
relying on global map information.
